# Conway's Game of Life
- It is just  a cellular automata, that was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
- It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply.
- Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

# Rules
## For a space that is populated: 
- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

## For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

# Examples
- For a space that is populated:

## for your knowledge
- it is an interactive game of life
- by using the 3 main keys listed below to control the game
  
```
        - ENTER     -> randomize the grid
        
  
        - BACKSPACE -> clear the grid
        

        - SPACEBAR  -> Iterator | the Patern generator
        
```
